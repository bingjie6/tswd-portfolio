# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau

For this Critique by Design assignment, I'm going to come up with a critique and a data visualization using information and data that was available either online or from the class. The steps are as follows:

Step one: select a visualization to redesign from MakeoverMonday (https://makeovermonday.co.uk/Links to an external site.).
Step two: critique the visualization
Step three: wireframe a solution
Step four: test the solution
Step five: build your solution

Don't waste any time. Let's get started!

## Step one: the visualization
<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/32549/average-effective-labor-market-exit-age-of-selected-countries/" title="Infographic: The Varying State of Retirement Ages | Statista"><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/32549.jpeg" alt="Infographic: The Varying State of Retirement Ages | Statista" width="100%" height="auto" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/>
</a> Data Source <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/32549/average-effective-labor-market-exit-age-of-selected-countries/">OECD</a>

I selected **"The Varying State of Retirement Ages"** visualization because it presents an important and widely relevant social and economic issue: the age at which people retire in different countries. Understanding global retirement ages is crucial for policymakers, labor economists, and even the general public, as it impacts national productivity, pension systems, healthcare costs, and the overall aging workforce. The visualization makes it easy to compare different countries' retirement trends, particularly in relation to the OECD average, which acts as a benchmark for evaluating a nation's standing in a global context. 

The topic also ties into broader conversations on aging populations, workforce sustainability, and gender disparities. By displaying the data for both men and women, this chart invites further analysis into how gender impacts retirement ages, offering insights into economic and social structures. Given the ongoing debates about labor force participation and retirement policies, particularly in aging nations, this visualization provides a clear and accessible entry point for discussions around global retirement trends.

## Step two: the critique
The graph clearly shows the retirement ages across various countries, and it's easy to compare men and women using the color coding (orange for men and purple for women). The dotted lines representing the OECD averages for both men and women make it easy to compare each country's values against these benchmarks. The arrangement of countries by order with easily recognizable flags adds context, allowing viewers to quickly identify the nations they are interested in. However, the bar chart doesn't differentiate very clearly between countries with small differences in retirement ages, which might lead to crowding or difficulty in exact interpretation. In addition, the chart labels for the country names could be improved in terms of size or placement. Some flags are less recognizable at a quick glance. The chart could also benefit from including exact values atop the bars to avoid forcing readers to estimate the heights.

The primary audience for this graph could be policymakers, retirement analysts, labor economists, or media professionals reporting on retirement trends. The visualization is somewhat effective for policymakers and analysts as it provides a clear overview of the average retirement age in a global context. However, for a general audience, the graph could be difficult to interpret without background knowledge, especially since the country flags are accompanied by abbreviated country names.

This visualization is evaluated according to Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](https://www.tableau.com/blog/stephen-few-data-visualization). Compared to the Good Charts method, this evaluation method pays additional attention to how the targeted audience perceives the visualization and its effectiveness in reaching the audience. The evaluation criteria are also more comprehensive in covering the truthfulness, completeness, and aesthetics of the visualization. To improve, the method could incorporate a walk-through of the graph, similar to the Good Charts method, identifying what the visualization tells at first glance and what information the graph is telling after careful exploration. For example, what color stands out first, or how does the shape, layout, and the design assist in delivering the information, etc.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution
I shared my sketch above with two different people and asked for their feedback by preparing interview questions.

Results: 

|                      Question                       | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|For this graphic, what do you see first?             |             |             |
|Can you describe to me what this is telling you?     |             |             |
|Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?  |             |             |
|Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  |             |             |
|Is there anything you would change or do differently?|             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
