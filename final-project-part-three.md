# Changes made since Part II
I have made several changes in Part III according to the interview feedback. Firstly, in response to feedback received on the "Vision Difficulty by U.S. States" map, I now include not just state-by-state comparisons but also specific percentages to improve clarity and make the data more accessible and understandable. By presenting information more clearly, the map now becomes more effective in targeting the potential audience, such as policymakers and the general public, who rely on accurate data to make informed decisions and understand the scope of vision difficulties across different regions.

The Call to Action section has been refined to incorporate more specific and actionable recommendations based on the interview feedback. For those with a higher risk of eye problems, I've included a table with suggestions related to frequent screen breaks and nutrient tips to alleviate the risks associated with unmanaged screen use and age. For healthcare professionals, I've suggested partnerships with educational organizations and community efforts to facilitate eye health awareness. For policymakers, I drew upon successful state policies and case studies documented by World Health Organization, thus making the actions more robust and directive.

According to the feedback received from my classmates, I've also highlighted the barriers that influence people's decision to visit eye doctors, such as unawareness of the need for regular eye exams, perceived high costs of care, lack of insurance coverage, and limited access to eye care providers in certain areas. This suggestion is very constructive as it completes policymakers' understanding of why some people do not seek eye care so as to develop more effective public health initiatives. Therefore, more individuals can benefit from the new policies on eye health.

To resolve the feedback from my professor and teaching assistant, I updated the Call to Action section to highlight some common signs of vision loss. Considering my target audience can be those potentially at a high risk of vision loss, I think including these common signs can lead them to seek professional advice at the onset of such symptoms rather than delaying until significant vision impairment occurs.

## The audience
The audience for my final data story includes:

1. Individuals at high risk for vision loss
This group of people can include students and office workers with unmanaged screen time who don't take frequent breaks between long screen time. I also target adults over 35 who are more prone to age-related eye conditions, as shown by the data visualization I've created.

2. Healthcare professionals
Healthcare professionals are closely related to preventing and protecting health-related problems and providing suggestions to their patients. They might find value in the role healthcare professionals can play in community education to promote eye care awareness.

3. Public health policymakers
To make eye health aware at the societal level, policies or initiatives must be taken into action. Public health policymakers can support initiatives that promote access to eye care and education on vision health and invest in public health campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of eye health.

By targeting these key groups, the final data story not only informs and educates but also drives action from those in a position to make a significant difference in public eye health, which I think is very comprehensive.

## Final design decisions
This project is structured as a step-by-step process, beginning with Part I and II and culminating in the final completed webpage in Part III. Each previous part lays the foundation for the next, ensuring that insights and developments are progressively built upon to enhance the final outcome.

In Part I, the groundwork is set by identifying the key objectives, establishing the project structure, and building the initial sketch. This initial phase involved extensive research and data collection, which enabled me to explore the topic that is backed up by a strong background knowledge. Identifying the methods and tools made it easier to transition to the next phase. As I move into Part II, the fundamental data I collected from the previous phase was transformed into interactive data visualizations I created via Tableau and preliminary designs on Shorthand. This stage is critical as it starts to bring the data to life and also makes it easier to collect feedback. Identifying the target audience enabled me to create tailored content and align their interest with my visualizations. The feedback I collected in this stage was valuable in suggesting a lot of perspectives to make the story more engaging and logical. I incorporated more actionable plans, successful case studies, refined visualizations, and more tailored content to the target audience in Part III. Besides data visualizations, I drew upon relevant research to complement the narrative and tell a more coherent story. This phase also focuses on final testing and revisions on Shorthand, making sure the layout is designed to be user-friendly and information flows logically.

The structured progression from topic brainstorming and fundamental research in Part I, to well-designed storyboards and feedback collection in Part II, leads to the comprehensive and engaging outcome in Part III. Each phase builds upon the previous one with careful planning and execution, allowing for continuos improvement based on user insights and feedback.
