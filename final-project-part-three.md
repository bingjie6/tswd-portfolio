# Changes made since Part II
I have made several changes in Part III according to the interview feedback. Firstly, in response to feedback received on the "Vision Difficulty by U.S. States" map, I now include not just state-by-state comparisons but also specific percentages to improve clarity and make the data more accessible and understandable. By presenting information more clearly, the map now becomes more effective in targeting the potential audience, such as policymakers and the general public, who rely on accurate data to make informed decisions and understand the scope of vision difficulties across different regions.

The Call to Action section has been refined to incorporate more specific and actionable recommendations based on the interview feedback. For those with a higher risk of eye problems, I've included a table with suggestions related to frequent screen breaks and nutrient tips to alleviate the risks associated with unmanaged screen use and age. For healthcare professionals, I've suggested partnerships with educational organizations and community efforts to facilitate eye health awareness. For policymakers, I drew upon successful state policies and case studies documented by World Health Organization, thus making the actions more robust and directive.

According to the feedback received from my classmates, I've also highlighted the barriers that influence people's decision to visit eye doctors, such as unawareness of the need for regular eye exams, perceived high costs of care, lack of insurance coverage, and limited access to eye care providers in certain areas. This suggestion is very constructive as it completes policymakers' understanding of why some people do not seek eye care so as to develop more effective public health initiatives. Therefore, more individuals can benefit from the new policies on eye health.
