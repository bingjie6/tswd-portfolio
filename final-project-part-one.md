# Eye Health: Why it matters

# Outline

## High-Level Summary
In this project, I will explore the significance of eye health and its impact on overall well-being. The focus will be on understanding common eye conditions, their causes, and preventive measures that individuals can adopt. My goal is to emphasize the importance of regular eye exams, early detection, and lifestyle adjustments that can preserve and improve vision.

This project will aim to raise awareness about how critical eye health is in our daily lives, both for individuals and the society at large. By highlighting the potential long-term effects of neglecting eye care, such as vision loss and reduced quality of life, I hope to inspire proactive behaviors toward maintaining healthy eyes. The project will also address how socioeconomic factors and access to healthcare play a role in disparities in eye health outcomes.
