# Eye Health: Why it matters

# Outline

## High-Level Summary
In this project, I will explore the significance of eye health and its impact on overall well-being. The focus will be on understanding common eye conditions, their causes, and preventive measures that individuals can adopt. My goal is to emphasize the importance of regular eye exams, early detection, and lifestyle adjustments that can preserve and improve vision.

This project will aim to raise awareness about how critical eye health is in our daily lives, both for individuals and the society at large. By highlighting the potential long-term effects of neglecting eye care, such as vision loss and reduced quality of life, I hope to inspire proactive behaviors toward maintaining healthy eyes.

## Project Structure
**1. Introduction: Why Eye Health Matters** <br />
The project will begin with a compelling fact/story about the rise in preventable blindness, emphasizing the significant effect of eye health on overall well-being. It will set the tone by outlining the purpose which is to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining healthy eyes and preventing vision loss.

**2. American Eye Health Overview** <br />
Here, I will provide data visualizations surrounding the leading causes of blindness and low vision in the United States, the number of Americans with vision problems by demographics, and people's perception of medical tests. It will depend on the availability and quality of relevant datasets.

**3. Impact of Eye Health on Daily Life** <br />
This section will demonstrate how vision affects daily activities like driving and working. It will also explore the emotional and social consequences of vision loss based on available research and studies, showing how poor eye health impacts productivity and incurs high healthcare costs.

**4. Preventive Measures** <br />
The focus will be on the importance of regular eye exams and practical tips for maintaining eye health. Considering the increasing screen time of modern people, I may also analyze the impact of excessive screen time and bring awareness to visiting eye doctors regularly.

**5. Call to Action** <br />
This section will urge the audience to prioritize regular eye exams, limit screen time, and adopt healthy habits to protect their eyes. I may also utilize personal story to reinforce the message that early detection and lifestyle changes can prevent serious vision problems.
